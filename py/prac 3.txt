1. Write a program to print the sum of the numbers from 1 to n where n is the user input

n = int(input("Enter a number n: ")) 
sum_of_numbers = n * (n + 1) // 2 
print(f"The sum of numbers from 1 to {n} is: {sum_of_numbers}") 



2. write a program to print the sum of the x series y=x^1+x^2+ x^3+.....+x^n where x & n are the user inputs

x = int(input("Enter the value of x: ")) 
n = int(input("Enter the value of n: ")) 
sum_of_series = 0 
for i in range(1, n + 1): 
    sum_of_series += x ** i  
print(f"The sum of the series y = x^1 + x^2 + ... + x^n is:{sum_of_series}")



3. Write a program to accept a number and check if its prime or not

num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
is_prime = True 
if num < 2: 
    is_prime = False 
else: 
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1): 
        if num % i == 0: 
            is_prime = False 
            break 
if is_prime: 
    print(f"{num} is a prime number.") 
else: 
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")


4.write a program to print all the prime no in a given range where range end is user input 

# Program to print all prime numbers in a given range 
n = int(input("Enter range : ")) 
for i in range(2, n+1): 
    if n>1: 
        for j in range(2, i):
            if i%j==0: 
                break 
        else: 
            print(f"{i} is a prime  number")

4. Write a program to accept a  number n and print the prime numbers from 1 to n.

5. write a program to print the multiplication table from 1 to n where n 
is user input. 

#Program to print tables of range 
n = int(input("Enter tables to print : ")) 
for i in range(1, n+1): 
    print(f"Table of {i}") 
    for j in range(1, 11): 
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {i*j}") 


6. Write a program to print the fibonacci series for n terms

#Program to print first n of fibonacci series 
n = int(input("Enter limit : ")) 
a,b = 0,1 
print(a, b, end=" ") 
for i in range(2, n):
    a,b = b,a+b 
    print(b, end= " ") 

7.Write a program to accept a string and display characters that are present at even indexes 
#Program to print even indexes of a string 
n = input("Enter string : ") 
for i in range(len(n)): 
    if i%2==0: 
        print(n[i], end=" ") 

8.	Write a program  to print the pyramid pattern. 
n = int(input("Enter limit : ")) 
for i in range(n+1): 
    for j in range(i): 
        print("*", end=" ") 
print()
