1.Write a program to check if the number is even or odd.

code:

n=int(input("Enter a number")) 

if n%2==0: 

    print(f' {n} is even') 

else: 

    print(f' {n} is odd') 

2. Write a program to accept 3 sides of  triangle and check whether the triangle is scalene , 
isosceles ,or equilateral triangle.

code:

s1=int(input("Enter value of side1"))  

s2=int(input("Enter value of side2"))  

s3=int(input("Enter value of side3"))  

if(s1==s2==s3): 

    print("The given Triangle is Equilateral")  

elif(s1 == s2 or s2 == s3 or s1 == s3):  

    print("The given triangle is isoceles")  

else:  

    print("The given triangle is scalar")




3. Write a program to accept student details (First name , Middle name, Last name, Course , 
Semester, and marks of 5 subjects) and display the students report card which has the 
student details grade and status as pass or fail. 
GRADE CRITERIA: 
Percentage>=90 → O GRADE 
Percentage>=80 → A GRADE 
Percentage>=70 → B GRADE 
Percentage>=60 → C GRADE 
Percentage>=50 → D GRADE  
Percentage>=40 → E GRADE 
Percentage<40   → F GRADE 
NOTE: O to E grade should have the status as PASS and F grade should have the status 
as FAIL

code:

name = input("Enter the Name: ") 
mname = input("Enter the Middle Name: ") 
lname = input("Enter the Last Name: ") 
course = input("Enter the Course: ") 
sem = input("Enter the Semester: ") 
m1 = int(input("Enter the marks in Python: ")) 
m2 = int(input("Enter the marks in FMS: ")) 
m3 = int(input("Enter the marks in BM: ")) 
m4 = int(input("Enter the marks in WP: ")) 
m5 = int(input("Enter the marks in EV: ")) 
p = (m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5) / 500 * 100 
if p >= 90: 
    grade = "O" 
elif 80 <= p < 90: 
    grade = "A" 
elif 70 <= p < 80:
    grade = "B"
elif 60 <= p < 70: 
    grade = "C" 
elif 50 <= p < 60: 
    grade = "D" 
elif 40 <= p < 50: 
    grade = "E" 
else: 
    grade = "F" 
print(f"Name: {name} {mname} {lname}") 
print(f"Course: {course}") 
print(f"Semester: {sem}") 
print(f"Percentage: {p}%") 
print(f"Grade: {grade}") 
print("Status: Pass" if grade != "F" else "Status: Fail")

4. Write a program to implement a nested conditional statement.(if num  >0  and even then find practorial if its odd print num is odd else if num<0 print its negative)

num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
if num > 0:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        factorial = 1 
        for i in range(1, num + 1):
            factorial *= i 
        print(f"The number is positive and even. Factorial of {num} is {factorial}.")  
    else:  
        print(f"The number {num} is positive and odd.") 
else: 
    print(f"The number {num} is negative.")


5. Write a program to implement a two player ROCK , PAPER and SCISSOR game. 

print("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!") 
print("Players, please choose one of the following options: rock,paper, or scissors.\n")  
player1_choice = input("Player 1, enter your choice: ").lower() 
player2_choice = input("Player 2, enter your choice: ").lower() 
valid_choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"] 
if player1_choice not in valid_choices or player2_choice not in valid_choices: 
    print("Invalid input! Please enter rock, paper, or scissors.") 
else: 
    if player1_choice == player2_choice: 
        print("It's a tie!") 
    elif player1_choice == "rock" and player2_choice == "scissors": 
        print("Player 1 wins! Rock beats Scissors.") 
    elif player1_choice == "scissors" and player2_choice == "paper": 
        print("Player 1 wins! Scissors beats Paper.") 
    elif player1_choice == "paper" and player2_choice == "rock": 
        print("Player 1 wins! Paper beats Rock.")
    elif player2_choice == "rock" and player1_choice == "scissors": 
        print("Player 2 wins! Rock beats Scissors.") 
    elif player2_choice == "scissors" and player1_choice == "paper": 
        print("Player 2 wins! Scissors beats Paper.") 
    elif player2_choice == "paper" and player1_choice == "rock": 
        print("Player 2 wins! Paper beats Rock.")
